Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning with UCF50 Dataset
This project is about recognizing human activities using machine learning models, specifically CNN and LSTM models, with the UCF50 dataset. The UCF50 dataset consists of 50 classes of human activities, such as running, walking, jumping, and playing instruments, captured from YouTube videos. Each video clip is approximately 10 seconds long and has a resolution of 320x240 pixels.

Dataset
The UCF50 dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.php. The dataset contains 50 folders, each corresponding to a different activity class. Each folder contains video clips in .avi format. The dataset also includes a file named "classInd.txt" that maps each activity class to an integer value.

Preprocessing
The first step is to preprocess the videos and extract the features. The videos can be converted to frames, and the frames can be resized to a specific size, such as 224x224 pixels. The extracted frames can then be fed into a pre-trained CNN model, such as VGG16 or ResNet50, to extract the features. These features can then be stored in a file or a database.

Model Training
The next step is to train the machine learning models using the extracted features. We will use two types of models: CNN and LSTM.

CNN Model
The CNN model can be trained using the extracted features as input and the activity classes as output. The output layer can have 50 nodes, one for each activity class. We can use the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The model can be trained for a few epochs, and the accuracy can be monitored to avoid overfitting.

LSTM Model
The LSTM model can be trained using the time-series features extracted from the videos. The time-series features can be extracted by dividing the video into segments, and each segment can be fed into the pre-trained CNN model to extract the features. The extracted features can then be fed into the LSTM model. The LSTM model can have several LSTM layers followed by a dense output layer with 50 nodes. We can use the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The model can be trained for a few epochs, and the accuracy can be monitored to avoid overfitting.

Evaluation
The performance of the trained models can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models can also be tested on a separate test set to measure their generalization performance.

Conclusion
Human activity recognition using machine learning models such as CNN and LSTM can be an effective way to automatically recognize human activities. The UCF50 dataset provides a useful resource for developing and evaluating such models.
